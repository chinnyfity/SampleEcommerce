# Sample Ecommerce Web App

1. The database of the project is attached to your mail
2. Do composer update to install the vendor folder
3. The API postman collection is send to your email, you just need to import it in json format thats all
4. On the postman baseUrl, replace the localhost with your live api
   For example replace "http://127.0.0.1:9002/" with "https://yourdomain.com/" (dont forget the last slash, very important)
5. Also on the .env file, you need to replace "http://127.0.0.1:9002" too
6. This is how you will use it on postman 
https://yourdomain.com/api/products
https://yourdomain.com/api/view/471595/abstract-composition-m370-drawing/
and so on...


## Important Notice
1. I just roughly designed a sample ecommerce platform (i took time on the backend and apis more than i did on the frontend). Kindly refer to my project links on my CV to see my latest projects
2. I had to created a separate routes for both the web and api
3. When you checkout, it saves your cart details, user details and creates a transaction history in the database
4. It sends an email notification to the admin
5. And clears the cart
6. Thank you!
